  # the ? operator does not work on lists or maps
  # to optionally use a list value we merge a map with the optional enforcement
  # value set (here local.def) for the requested key with an map
  # containing the optiobal value.
  # if the value is not set (empty list) just another key than the requested
  # one is used to create the merge map. Then the merge result for the
  # key falls back to the entry in the given map or the default.
  # The final result then is just the lookup of the requested key
  # in the merged map.
